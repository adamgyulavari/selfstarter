        What can you expect?

        Okay, but seriously, what's in the price?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The not so fancy accomodation (some kind of t√°bor) where we can play loud music and we have shelter from rain. A dinner for Friday evening, full meals for Saturday and breakfast for Sunday. The rest is logistics and booze.
